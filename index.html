        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi,
My Name is Hadiyah Bahta. I'm a fourth year student at the University of Riverside, California. I transferred from Cypress community college where I started at the age of 16 after passing the Chspe in High School and graduating early after my sophomore year. I am currently a Sociology major with the intention to go into marketing post grad. I selected Sociology as my major because it provides powerful insights into the social processes shaping the lives, experiences, problems and possibilities of our contemporary world.
<br><br>

        Throughout my time at the University of California Riverside, I have dipped my toes into different branches in order to really make the most of my time as a college student and see where I can use the experiences and opportunities given to me to my benefit. My first experience in the Work field was as a Communications and Programs intern with the organization CAIR  where I assisted in a variety of tasks. This included, assisting with writing, collecting, and editing content for written publications and website, aggregating & writing content for daily & weekly email newsletters, coordinating & running CAIRâ€™s social media platforms & online outreach, coordinating & running CAIRâ€™s biweekly CAIR on Air online programming and other digital events, developing social media strategies & Historical media preservation, Covering events/ press conferences, Writing original op-eds and blog posts, and Helping promote work across various platforms. Throughout my internship, I learned key skills such as strong logical reasoning skills, the ability to craft strategic, compelling messaging for target audiences, ability to work under very strict time constraints, social media and management experience and media archiving. 
<br><br>

        My time as an intern opened my eyes to the world of marketing through Sociology. The core function of marketing is to influence behavior, and the hardest part about this is  understanding people and why they do what they do. With my background in Sociology I plan to use the knowledge  Iâ€™ve gained and input that into the Marketing field. Additionally, Iâ€™ve spent my time volunteering for a non profit that provides housing for the homeless in Corona, California. While I wasn't able to start working there immediately, I used my networking skills in order to get my foot in the door and have some added experience in social work. While I learned so much through my internship experience, a paid working job was my biggest necessity to get through college. I spent my extra time out of school working as a server to pay through college at a Mediterranean restaurant the rest of my time at UCR. While it may seem mundane, working as a server taught me many important skills. As a server, your main priority is to cater to your customers and make sure they leave with a good experience. Through my background in Sociology, it teaches youThe ability to read people and situations, by taking their background into consideration which in turns aids you in providing the best possible services for their individual needs. Additionally, you
Understand how to deal with people from many different backgrounds, be it socioeconomically, cultural, age etc.
My serving taught me the importance of customer service, communication, conflict resolution and most importantly problem solving which are all necessary when entering the work field.
